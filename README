You have to set up ZooKeeper before you can use the new resolver.

LibRIPC uses base directory (znode) "/libRIPC". Znode creation is possible for
all processes in the network. Deleting them or modifying the base directory
should only be possible for administrators. Thus, create the base directory with
credentials for admin $user with passphrase $pass (digest auth scheme):

	CRED=`echo -n "$user:$pass" | openssl dgst -binary -sha1 | openssl base64`

Or, alternatively:

	CRED=`echo -n "$user:$pass" | sha1sum | cut -d\  -f1 | xxd -r -p | base64`

And in zkCli (ZooKeeper "Shell"):

	create /libRIPC libRIPC_base_dir digest:$user:$CRED:crdwa,world:anyone:rc
